Online Hidden-semi Markov Models for Bayesian Online Detection and Prediction of Change Points
=========================

Implementation of Online HSMMs which eases the implementation of custom emission processes. In particular, emission processes which jointly depend on the hidden state and duration are supported.

There is also a python script for plotting the inferences drawn from the model.

## Requirements

The framework requires the following ubuntu packages:

```
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev nlohmann-json-dev libarmadillo-dev cmake
```

If the ProMPs functionality is also wanted then you'll need to install TODO.

## Examples

Examples of HSMMs with different emission processes can be found in the examples folder distributed with the code.

## References

TODO: Add link to the paper.
